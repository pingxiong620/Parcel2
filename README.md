# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm pstart`

Runs the app in the development mode with parcel 2 serve.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run pbuild`

Builds the app with parcel2 to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is not optimized so source map is available.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
